# Overview & motivation


### What is the current situation/problem, what are the aims of the project?

The repetition positivity (RP) is a slow fronto-central located positive wave occuring between 50 and 250 ms poststimulus which is observable when listening both passively and actively to a repeated standard stimulus. Previous research has found that the RP amplitude increases with stimulus repetition (Henschel et al. 2005). However it is unclear how the RP behaves after an "interruption" by a deviant.

### What is the motivation to conduct the project?

I am interested in both auditory perception and EEG. I would like to learn how to do EEG data processing using python and how to analyze and interpret the results.

### What is the proposed approach to conduct the project?

I want to approach that project by using an open-source EEG oddball dataset. A more detailed description of the approach can be found [here](https://hibiki0827.github.io/backsta/project.html)
