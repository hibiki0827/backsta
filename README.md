## "What's in this repository?"

This repository contains the jupyter book for the project backsta conducted within SummerTerm2021 Methodological working in neuroscience.

Using a dataset of an auditory oddball task, I would like to investigate the standard stimuli that directly follow after a target or non-target deviant to determine how the brain reacts when going back to the standard pattern (e.g. whether the brain completely resets). I want to use the “repetition positivity” to see whether its amplitude is completely reset after a deviant or whether it only decreases. Furthermore I would like to know whether there is a difference whether the deviant beforehand was a target or not (so whether a given task was completed).
