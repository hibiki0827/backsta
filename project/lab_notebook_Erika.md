# week 10. 05. - 16. 05.

* updating readme.md
* updating data.md
* updating dataaccess.md
* updating project.md
* creating timeline in gitkarten
* creating project in osf.io
* looking for more literature
* still to do: preregistration in osf.io   -> still not sure what the exact hypothesis is

whiat I am thinking about right now:

the repetition positivity 
* the repetition positivity reflects the repetition supression
* higher sensory levels provide prediction signal to lower levels
* suppression of prediction error
* slow positive wave from 5 - 250ms SOT inceasing with standard stimulus repetition

I should expect a repetition positivity that increases for every repetition (e.g. Bladweg 2007)

I should see a MMN for the deviants 

problem: what should I expect for the standard right after the Deviant
* one version: RP increases with repetiton ->  does not only depend on the last stimulus -> there could be an decrease but according to the pattern before the deviant the standard is still somehow expected
* another version: the deviant makes the brain reset the prediction -> no repetition positivity should be seen
